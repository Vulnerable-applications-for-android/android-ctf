    <p>We teach undergraduate software engineering as a tandem of courses:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://dslab.epfl.ch/teaching/sweng">CS-305: Software Engineering</a> (<em>SwEng</em>),
            in the Fall semester, and
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://dslab.epfl.ch/teaching/sweng/proj">CS-306: Software Development
            Project</a> (<em>SDP</em>), in the Spring semester
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Together, they cover the basics of modern software development, focusing on techniques and
        practices used
        to build computer software that meets high standards of quality, reliability, security, and
        maintainability.</p>

    <p>All course materials are hosted in our <a href="https://github.com/sweng-epfl/public">public
        repo</a>.
        All EPFL-specific details appear below.</p>

    <p>The two courses are designed to be taken as a sequence. If a student already masters the
        SwEng material,
        taking SwEng is an easy refresher; if not, then succeeding in SDP is highly improbable.
        Therefore,
        students can either take SwEng on its own, or SwEng together with SDP. If you insist on
        taking SDP
        without taking SwEng before, you must first contact us and
        explain why.</p>

    <p id="greeting"></p>
